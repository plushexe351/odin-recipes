# odin-recipes

Project - Recipes, from The Odin Project Fundamentals Course

Description :

* The website consists of a main index page with links to a few recipes
* index.html file contains links to 3 recipe pages of similar structure: 1. french_toasts.html 2. lasagna.html 3. scrambled_eggs.html

P.S. - The coding is pretty flawed and all over the place right now, will tidy it up soon !

What I learnt from this project :
Project Recipes being my first HTML project helped me get a better grasp on basic HTML concepts
such as tags, elements, lists, links and images.
