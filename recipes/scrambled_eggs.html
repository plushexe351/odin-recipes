    <h2>Description</h2>
    These <strong>baked scrambled eggs</strong> are <i>light and fluffy</i> and are a snap to put
    together for a big crowd. I usually make two pans for our Christmas brunch,
    and I never have many leftovers!

    </ul>

        Whisk together eggs and salt in a large bowl until well-blended.
